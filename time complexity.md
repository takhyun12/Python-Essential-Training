| Operation | Example | Big-O | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8,000&nbsp;Hz | Adequate for human speech but without sibilance. Used in telephone/walkie-talkie. |
| 11,025&nbsp;Hz | Used for lower-quality PCM, MPEG audio and for audio analysis of subwoofer bandpasses. |
| 16,000&nbsp;Hz | Used in most VoIP and VVoIP, extension of telephone narrowband. |
| 22,050&nbsp;Hz | Used for lower-quality PCM and MPEG audio and for audio analysis of low frequency energy. |
| 44,100&nbsp;Hz | Audio CD, most commonly used rate with MPEG-1 audio (VCD, SVCD, MP3). Covers the 20 kHz bandwidth. |
| 48,000&nbsp;Hz | Standard sampling rate used by professional digital video equipment, could reconstruct frequencies up to 22 kHz. |
| 88,200&nbsp;Hz | Used by some professional recording equipment when the destination is CD, such as mixers, EQs, compressors, reverb, crossovers and recording devices. |
| 96,000&nbsp;Hz | DVD-Audio, LPCM DVD tracks, Blu-ray audio tracks, HD DVD audio tracks. |
| 176,400&nbsp;Hz | Used in HDCD recorders and other professional applications for CD production. |
| 192,000&nbsp;Hz | Used with audio on professional video equipment. DVD-Audio, LPCM DVD tracks, Blu-ray audio tracks, HD DVD audio tracks. |
| 352,800&nbsp;Hz | 	Digital eXtreme Definition. Used for recording and editing Super Audio CDs. |
| 384,000&nbsp;Hz | Highest sample rate available for common software. Allows for precise peak detection. |
